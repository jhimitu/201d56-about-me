# 201d56-about-me

This is my portfolio website. Here you will find some information about me as a software engineer as well as some fun and interesting facts. Rather than just list off all of my interesting qualities, you (the user) get to guess them in a fun quiz I built. I hope you enjoy!

This website was worked on by both myself as the Navigator and rjbrons (Robert) as the Driver.
